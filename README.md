# Heart Disease ML Dashboard ❤️📊

## Overview
This is an **academic project** that applies **machine learning** to heart disease data and presents results through an interactive dashboard built with **Dash** and **Plotly**.  
The system integrates classification, clustering, and association rule mining to support medical data analysis.  

⚠️ Note: This is a **prototype for educational purposes only** and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.  

## Features
- 🤖 **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- 📊 **Performance Comparison**: Test vs Cross-validation accuracy, confusion matrices  
- 🌲 **Feature Importance**: Insights from Random Forest  
- 🔵 **Clustering (K-Means + PCA)**: Patient group segmentation with profiles  
- 🔗 **Association Rules**: Discover frequent patterns and correlations  
- 📈 **Data Overview**: Attribute descriptions, distributions, target variable analysis  

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, mlxtend  
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Dash  
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  

## Usage
1. Place `heart.csv` in the project directory.  
2. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python PBL2_HeartDisease.py
